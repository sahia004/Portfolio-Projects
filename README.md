# Portfolio-Projects
For my first project "Creating a Virtual Network" the objective was 
Scenario:
You're hired by an IT company as an IT subject matter expert. The client wants to upgrade their IT systems within a limited budget and space constraints. You propose implementing virtual machines to reduce costs and meet operational needs effectively. The upgrade involves installing a Firewall, a PC for the CEO, an internal Webserver, an internal DNS server, and Linux machines for monitoring and cybersecurity tasks. After installation, you'll document configurations and create a security baseline by scanning for open ports.

Project Tasks:

Utilize the attached network diagram for guidance throughout the project.
Successfully install and configure Linux virtual machines.
Configure network interfaces and utilize network tools.
Create a security baseline by scanning for open ports.

For my second project 

For my third project, "Identify Vulnerabilities" 

Scenario:
Following a successful network upgrade installation for your company's client, you're now tasked with providing cybersecurity services. The client has hired a consultant to set up a new server in their internal network for production and operations support. Your job is to identify vulnerabilities in the new Production server and demonstrate potential exploits. Additionally, you'll perform the same assessment on the Webserver in their DMZ.

Project Tasks:

Use the attached network diagram for guidance in assessing the new Production server.
Ensure the VirtualBox network created in Project 1 is fully functional.
Scan the Production server and the Webserver in the DMZ to enumerate vulnerabilities.
Analyze vulnerabilities for exploitability and execute exploits against target computers.
Demonstrate the creation of persistence.

For my fourth project, "Penetration Testing", 

Scenario:
Following your previous work with the client, they've requested a formal penetration test for a new server. The key points of the contract include:

Scope of Work:

Penetration test conducted during normal business hours.
Assessment duration: Two weeks, ending with a presentation to client management and submission of a formal written report.
A dedicated workstation within the client network provided for the penetration tester.
"Black box" scenario: Penetration tester given no prior knowledge of the server being tested.
